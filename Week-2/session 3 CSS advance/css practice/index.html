                    Yesterday,
                        All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
                        Now my database has gone away.
                        Oh I believe in yesterday.
                    
                </div>

                <div class="gray-box">
                    Suddenly,
                        There's not half the files there used to be,
                        And there's a milestone hanging over me. 
                        The system crashed so suddenly.
                        I pushed something wrong,
                        What it was I could not say.
                    
                </div>
            
                <div class="mustard-box">
                    
                        Now all my data's gone
                        And I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

                <div class="red-box">
                    
                        Yesterday, 
                        The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
                        I knew my data was all here to stay,
                        Now I believe in yesterday.
